This HOWTO explains how to install the needed library for handling GIF image with Perl on Mac OS X Yosemite. This has been tested on MacOS X 10.10.2.

This is required for the automatic login on Bank online account when the passcode is dealed with a GIF captcha (most of the time a grid of digits from 0 to 9 to select)

First you need a compiler for compiling library sources. For this, install Xcode from Apple Store. This is a regular Apple application, thus it will be automatically download from apple store and install in the Application directory.
For validating the installation, you have to accept the Xcode licence. For this, open a Terminal App and run the following command:
> sudo xcodebuild -license

Now we are going to build the GIF library. The source can be found on sourceforge:
For example, download giflib-5.1.1 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/giflib/). Then the sequence of commands is:

> tar -xzf giflib-5.1.1.tar.gz
> cd giflib-5.1.1
>./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --without-x CFLAGS='-arch x86_64 -arch i386'
> make
> sudo make install

This sequence installs the GIF library in the directory /usr/local/lib/. That can’t harm your system.

Then you have to install the Perl module « Imager » that does the binding between the GIF library and the Perl context.
First of all, download the Imager CPAN module at http://search.cpan.org/~tonyc/Imager-1.003/Imager.pm. Assuming the downloaded archive is Imager-1.003.tar.gz, the sequence of commands is:

> tar -xzf  Imager-1.003.tar.gz
> cd  Imager-1.003
> perl Makefile.PL --libpath=/usr/local/lib/ --incpath=/usr/local/include/

Imager's Makefile.PL produces an epilogue that should indicate the following:

	Libraries found:
  	  GIF
	Libraries *not* found:
	  FT1
	  FT2
	  JPEG
	  PNG
	  T1
	  TIFF
	  Win32
Then type the following:
> make
> sudo make install

You are done!
